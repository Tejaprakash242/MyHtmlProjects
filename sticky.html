      <p>
        In the context of a website, the "About Us" page is a common example.
        This page is dedicated to offering insights into the identity and ethos
        of the business or organization. It helps establish a connection with
        the audience by sharing relevant details about the entity's history,
        values, and the people behind its operations. The "About" section is an
        essential component for building trust, credibility, and a sense of
        transparency with website visitors or potential customers.

      <h2>Bounce:</h2>
      <p>
        The height the box reaches during each bounce typically decreases
        because some energy is lost during each collision. This energy loss is
        often due to factors like the deformation of the box, air resistance,
        and other dissipative forces. The study of such phenomena falls under
        the branch of physics known as mechanics, specifically in the realm of
        collisions and conservation of energy.

      <p>
        In the context of computers and technology, a "basic screen" typically
        refers to the display screen or monitor that shows visual output from a
        computer or other electronic device. It can be a liquid crystal display
        (LCD), light-emitting diode (LED), or other technologies.
